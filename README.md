Dumping ground for my experiments with Connectomes, ML, Spiking Neural Networks etc. 


### TCF
`TCF` or `The-Connectome-Framework` is a framework for building/experimenting with connectomes.

See `data/connectome/` for connectome (e.g. C.Elegans) model files.

### Contributing
Don't bother ! (Unless you are crazy and interested in connectomes)
